# GeoTag
App for user inputed markers on a map. Each custom marker can be tailored to what the user wants it to be, adding fields like "name", "ID", "Number" etc.
The user can choose between a static map or a map that continuously uses the Google Map API. 
The user can also upload their own custom map/picture to be used in the map.
